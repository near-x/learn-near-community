Today, Ethereum is the number one smart contract platform in the crypto space, with a majority of smart contracts and decentralized applications based (dApps) based on its blockchain. Like Ethereum, there are several other smart contract platforms in the market as well. 

However, just because Ethereum is the number one platform when it comes to smart contracts and DeFi, does not mean it does not have problems. Ethereum has one glaring problem, and that is significant scalability problems. It just cannot get its network to scale. 

This is where the NEAR Protocol comes into the picture. NEAR’s USP is that it uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism that utilizes sharding. Before we dive deeper, let us get to know both Ethereum and NEAR. 
今天，以太坊是加密领域排名第一的智能合约平台，大多数智能合约和去中心化应用程序 (dApps) 都基于其区块链。 与以太坊一样，市场上还有其他几个智能合约平台。

然而，仅仅因为以太坊是智能合约和 DeFi 的第一平台，并不意味着它没有问题。 以太坊有一个明显的问题，那就是严重的可扩展性问题。 它只是无法扩展其网络。

这就是 NEAR 协议出现的地方。 NEAR 的 USP 是它使用利用分片的权益证明共识机制。 在我们深入研究之前，让我们先了解一下以太坊和 NEAR。
What Is Ethereum? 
If you look at Ethereum’s definition on its website, it is as follows –

“Ethereum is a technology that’s home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It’s open to everyone, wherever you are in the world.”

Founded in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has firmly established itself as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin. Ethereum builds upon Bitcoin’s blockchain, making it more than just another cryptocurrency that allows users to send or receive value without any third-party intervention. 

Ethereum ensures decentralization by replacing central servers with thousands of nodes, ensuring that the platform is always online and free from any third-party influence. Smart contracts also form an integral part of Ethereum’s ecosystem, and because the platform supports both decentralized applications and smart contracts, it is exceptionally appealing to developers and users alike. 

Ethereum is now moving to Ethereum 2.0 or Serenity. The upgrade will significantly improve the blockchain’s scalability, efficiency, and speed of the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, the upgrade will allow Ethereum to reduce gas costs and process more transactions, improving the scalability of the blockchain without compromising on security. 

The upgrade will also see Ethereum switch to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. PoS will see validators who have been chosen algorithmically provide security to the platform. The validators will secure the platform by locking up their ETH. Any validator that acts against the interest of the platform has their stake slashed, ensuring the platform’s security. 
什么是以太坊？
如果你在其网站上查看以太坊的定义，它是这样的——

“以太坊是一种技术，它是数字货币、全球支付和应用程序的所在地。该社区已经建立了蓬勃发展的数字经济，为创作者提供了大胆的在线赚钱新方式等等。它对所有人开放，无论您身在何处。”

以太坊由 Vitalik Buterin 于 2015 年创立，已稳固地成为市值第二大的加密货币，仅次于比特币。以太坊建立在比特币的区块链之上，使其不仅仅是另一种允许用户在没有任何第三方干预的情况下发送或接收价值的加密货币。

以太坊通过用数千个节点替换中央服务器来确保去中心化，确保平台始终在线且不受任何第三方影响。智能合约也是以太坊生态系统不可或缺的一部分，由于该平台同时支持去中心化应用程序和智能合约，因此对开发者和用户都极具吸引力。

以太坊现在正在转向以太坊 2.0 或 Serenity。升级将显着提高区块链的可扩展性、效率和以太坊区块链的速度。此外，升级将使以太坊能够降低燃料成本并处理更多交易，在不影响安全性的情况下提高区块链的可扩展性。

升级还将使以太坊转向权益证明共识机制。 PoS 将看到通过算法选择的验证者为平台提供安全性。验证者将通过锁定他们的 ETH 来保护平台。任何违背平台利益的验证者都将削减其股权，确保平台的安全。
What Is the NEAR Protocol? 
The NEAR Protocol came into existence in the summer of 2018. A decentralized development platform, the protocol was designed to create the perfect environment for decentralized applications, focusing on the shortcomings of other platforms in the smart contract and dApp space. These shortcomings are mainly issues with low speeds, low throughput, and poor compatibility with other chains. 

NEAR operates on top of the NEAR Protocol, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, incorporating several features and innovations to reduce costs and improve scalability for both users and developers. In addition, NEAR takes a unique approach to “Sharding.”

It also introduces a block generation mechanism called “Doomslug” that was proposed in 2019. Doomslug allows practical or “Doomslug” finality, ensuring that the blocks receive finality in seconds.

The protocol is based on the same technology as Bitcoin, combining it with features such as database sharding. NEAR Protocol is built from scratch and is the most accessible network for end-users and developers while also ensuring scalability and security. 

Most scalable blockchains centralize processing, limiting it to high-end hardware, which provides a temporary boost to their throughput, NEAR allows the platform to scale linearly, upto billions of transactions in a completely decentralized way. 

NEAR is developed by the NEAR collective, a community of developers and researchers collaborating on building the project. Some important features of NEAR are 

NEAR is a sharded system that allows for infinite scalability. 
An easy-to-use protocol, NEAR allows developers to build apps easily and quickly. 
NEAR is not a side chain but a Layer-1 protocol. 
dApps created using NEAR run on top of the underlying NEAR layer. 
什么是 NEAR 协议？
NEAR 协议诞生于 2018 年夏天。 一个去中心化的开发平台，该协议旨在为去中心化应用创造完美的环境，专注于智能合约和 dApp 空间中其他平台的缺点。这些缺点主要是低速、低吞吐量以及与其他链的兼容性差的问题。

NEAR 运行在 NEAR 协议之上，这是一种权益证明 (PoS) 区块链，结合了多项功能和创新，以降低成本并提高用户和开发人员的可扩展性。此外，NEAR 采用独特的“分片”方法。

它还引入了 2019 年提出的名为“Doomslug”的区块生成机制。 Doomslug 允许实际或“Doomslug”确定性，确保区块在几秒钟内获得确定性。

该协议基于与比特币相同的技术，并结合了数据库分片等功能。 NEAR 协议是从头开始构建的，是最终用户和开发人员最容易访问的网络，同时还确保了可扩展性和安全性。

大多数可扩展的区块链集中处理，将其限制在高端硬件上，这可以暂时提高其吞吐量，NEAR 允许平台以完全分散的方式线性扩展，最多可处理数十亿笔交易。

NEAR 由 NEAR 集体开发，这是一个由开发人员和研究人员组成的社区，合作构建该项目。 NEAR 的一些重要特性是

NEAR 是一个分片系统，允许无限的可扩展性。
NEAR 是一种易于使用的协议，允许开发人员轻松快速地构建应用程序。
NEAR 不是侧链，而是 Layer-1 协议。
使用 NEAR 创建的 dApp 运行在底层 NEAR 层之上。
What Is The NEAR Collective? 
NEAR Collective comprises individual organizations and other contributors that are continuously working on improving the NEAR Protocol. The Collective works on projects such as writing the initial code and implementation for the NEAR Network. NEAR is completely decentralized, operating independently and cannot be shut down or manipulated, even by those that built it.

The NEAR Collective has members such as the NEAR Foundation. The NEAR Foundation is a non-profit organization that is focused on creating a vibrant ecosystem around the NEAR blockchain. It helps in the coordination of governance activities and development. The NEAR Collective has several projects, with the NEAR blockchain just one of several projects under the aegis of the collective. 
什么是 NEAR 集体？
NEAR 集体由不断致力于改进 NEAR 协议的个人组织和其他贡献者组成。 该集体致力于为 NEAR 网络编写初始代码和实现等项目。 NEAR 是完全去中心化的，独立运行，不能被关闭或操纵，即使是那些构建它的人。

NEAR 集体 拥有 NEAR 基金会等成员。 NEAR 基金会是一个非营利组织，致力于围绕 NEAR 区块链创建一个充满活力的生态系统。 它有助于协调治理活动和发展。 NEAR 集体 有多个项目，NEAR 区块链只是该集体支持的几个项目之一。
